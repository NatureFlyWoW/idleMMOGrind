# Gear System

Gear slots, item quality tiers, acquisition sources, and the item level system.

## Gear Slots

Characters equip items in 15 slots:

**Armor (8 slots):**
- Head, Shoulders, Chest, Wrists, Hands, Waist, Legs, Feet

**Jewelry (6 slots):**
- Neck, Back, Ring 1, Ring 2, Trinket 1, Trinket 2

**Weapons (1-2 slots):**
- Main Hand, Off Hand / Two-Hand

## Item Quality Tiers

| Quality | Color | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Common | Gray | Vendor trash, early game |
| Uncommon | Green | Quest rewards, world drops (levels 1-30) |
| Rare | Blue | Dungeon bosses, rare spawns (levels 20-60) |
| Epic | Purple | Raid bosses, high-end dungeons (level 60+) |
| Legendary | Orange | Ultimate raid bosses, prestige content |

## Gear Acquisition

### Leveling Gear (1-59)

- Quest rewards provide steady upgrades every 2-3 levels
- World drops from monsters (random chance)
- Dungeon bosses guarantee rare-quality items
- Crafted gear from professions fills gaps

### Endgame Gear (Level 60)

| Source | Quality | Item Level |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Heroic Dungeons | Rare and Epic | 60-70 |
| 10-Player Raids | Epic | 71-80 |
| 25-Player Raids | Epic and Legendary | 81-90 |

Each endgame tier requires completing the previous tier for "attunement."

## Item Level System

Item Level (iLevel) determines stat budgets:

- Each quality tier has iLevel ranges
- Higher iLevel = more total stats on item
- Stat distribution varies by slot and type
- Average iLevel determines character power

## Set Bonuses

Tier set pieces from raids grant set bonuses at 2, 4, and 6 piece thresholds (see [dungeons-raids.md](dungeons-raids.md) for details on boss loot tables and tier tokens).
