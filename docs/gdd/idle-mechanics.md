# Idle Mechanics Design

Automation philosophy, active/idle gameplay loops, progression pacing, and offline balancing rules.

## Automation Philosophy

The game balances active engagement with idle automation through four principles:

1. **Always Progressing** -- Combat, questing, and gathering happen automatically
2. **Meaningful Choices** -- Players make strategic decisions about build, gear, and content
3. **Check-in Rewards** -- Returning to game provides satisfying progress summary
4. **No Artificial Gates** -- No energy systems or forced wait timers

## Active Play Session Flow (15-30 minutes)

1. Review offline progress and loot acquired
2. Equip gear upgrades (auto-equip option available)
3. Allocate stat/talent points from level-ups
4. Select next quest chain or content tier
5. Adjust build for upcoming challenges
6. Spend currencies at vendors
7. Craft items using gathered materials
8. Initiate dungeon/raid runs

## Idle/Offline Progression

- Combat continues automatically
- Quest objectives completed based on average clear time
- Loot accumulated in inventory (auto-sold if full)
- Profession gathering occurs passively
- Resources regenerate for next active session
- Up to 24 hours of progress calculated on return

## Progression Pacing

### Early Game (Levels 1-30)

- Rapid leveling: 1-2 levels per hour
- Frequent gear upgrades every 2-3 levels
- New abilities unlock regularly
- Simple combat rotation
- Focus on learning systems

### Mid Game (Levels 31-59)

- Moderate leveling: 1 level per 1-2 hours
- Gear upgrades every 4-5 levels
- Talent specialization deepens
- Combat complexity increases
- Dungeons become primary progression

### Endgame (Level 60)

- Focus shifts to gear item level
- Daily/weekly content structure
- Long-term goals (raid progression, reputations)
- Multiple concurrent objectives
- Preparation for Ascension

## Offline Balancing Rules

To prevent exploitation while maintaining satisfying returns:

- **Diminishing Returns** -- Offline efficiency reduces after 12 hours (100% for 0-12h, 75% for 12-18h, 50% for 18-24h)
- **Activity Caps** -- Dungeon/raid completions limited even offline (max 1 heroic dungeon, no raid progress)
- **Gear Quality Limits** -- Offline play caps at Rare quality drops; Epic+ requires active boss kills
- **Resource Caps** -- Inventory space limits gathering; full bags = excess sold for gold
- **Comeback Mechanics** -- Longer offline periods grant temporary XP/loot bonuses on return (2-5x multiplier)
