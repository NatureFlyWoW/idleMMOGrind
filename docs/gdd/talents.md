# Talent System

Talent point structure, tree tiers, example builds, and respec mechanics.

## Talent Points

- Gain 1 talent point per level starting at level 10 (**51 total points**)
- Each class has 3 talent trees (one per specialization, 25 points each tree)
- Points unlock more powerful abilities as you go deeper into a tree
- Can respec for gold cost (increases with each respec)

## Talent Tree Structure

Each tree contains 5 tiers with point thresholds:

| Tier | Points Required | Power Level |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Tier 1 | 0 points | Basic enhancements |
| Tier 2 | 5 points | Moderate power increases |
| Tier 3 | 10 points | Significant modifiers |
| Tier 4 | 15 points | Build-defining passives |
| Tier 5 | 20 points | Ultimate capstone talent |

## Example: Arcanist Pyromancy Tree

| Talent | Tier | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Searing Touch | Tier 1 | Crits cause burning DoT |
| Enhanced Flamebolt | Tier 2 | +15% Flamebolt damage |
| Infernal Focus | Tier 3 | +5% spell crit chance |
| Flame Eruption | Tier 4 | Consume DoTs for burst damage |
| Meteor Strike | Tier 5 | Unlock devastating fire spell |

## Respec Mechanics

- Players can respec (reset all talent points) for a gold cost
- Gold cost increases with each successive respec
- Encourages commitment to builds while allowing correction
